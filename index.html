              <p class="featured-list-icon-text">
              Posted on February 21, 2017
              </p>
            </a>
              <article id="one-post" class="collapse">
                <p>I’ve recently run a few websites through wave.webaim.org, an evaluation tool for web accessibility, and was surprised by the results. While my survey was in no way representative of the entire website population, I found that none of them passed. Zero. One really important step to take is to make sure all images have alternative text so that screen reading software can tell a visually impaired user what they are. Many websites got this right for pictures that were important to the website content, but missed an important few.</p>

                <p>While a sighted person would be able to easily tell whether or not a picture is important to the content, a screen reader wouldn’t. Images that are simply decorative should contain empty quotes. I didn’t really understand what the reasoning was behind taking the time to create alternative text when the quotes would just be empty, but there is a purpose. Including alt=”” hides the image from the screen reader so the user is not left wondering whether the image is important or not.</p>

                <p>Another type of image that often lacks alternative text is social media icons. Even though these aren’t important to the content of the website, they lead the user to more information. The best way to handle these is to think of them as doors.  If you’re walking along a row of stores, how do you tell which store you want to enter? There’s usually a sign on or near the entry door to let you know the name of the store. If there was no sign, you might simply pass by the store, continuing your search.</p>

                <p>Your alternative text should be short and simple, and clearly state where the user will go if he or she clicks. For example, alt=”go to Facebook” would be perfect for a Facebook icon. It describes that the image is also a link and that it takes the user to a different website.</p>

                <p class="featured-list-icon-text">
                  Posted on October 20, 2016
                </p>
            </a>
            <article id="two-post" class="collapse">
              <p>When I set out to specialize in accessibility, I had a certain high school student in mind who wants to become a teacher. I was thinking about all the limitations she’d have. How would she maintain classroom discipline? What would grading projects and papers be like? How would students let her know they had questions without everyone speaking at once? How would she know if a student was cheating? How would she keep up on information when Internet resources are becoming ever more popular?</p>

                <p>As I’ve delved further and further into accessibility, I’ve realized that some of these questions are already answered. Others still need creative minds to figure out a way to make currently inaccessible activities and jobs available to people with disabilities.</p>

                <p>One particular interaction from when I was a teller has stuck with me for years. A customer approached my station accompanied by a young man who was blind. The two conversed while I began to process the transaction, using the computer, counting the money, and writing on a paper form. The young man asked me if I thought he could do my job. I said, “I don’t see why not.” The customer then explained to the young man why it would not be possible. At the time, I was embarrassed to have answered him incorrectly, but now I see it differently.</p>

                <p>The more I mulled over the situation, the more I thought about how that young man must have felt, how he feels every time someone tells him, “No, you can’t do that because you’re blind.” At the time, maybe it wasn’t possible for someone with blindness to enter a money-handling or computer-use occupation. I’m not even sure if it’s possible now, but there are a lot of people out there saying, “I don’t see why not,” and they’re creating possibilities by removing limitations.</p>

                <p>What are your thoughts?</p>
